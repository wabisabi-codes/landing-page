# landing-page

Hi, My name is Ray and I am a Software Engineering Student at WGU.

This is a simple landing page. I built this landing page to demonstrate and practice basic knowledge of Css and HTML.
I have implemented CSS flexbox elements to gain more experience working with it. I have styled the landing page by creating a simple and easy-to-manuever design.
